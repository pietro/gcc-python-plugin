  Verify that the checker can cope with format codes that reference
  specific object subtypes (e.g. PyStringObject) but are supplied
  a PyObject ** instead.

  This was erroneously giving errors like this:
    error: Mismatching type in call to PyArg_ParseTuple with format code "S" [-fpermissive]
      argument 3 ("&stringobj") had type "struct PyObject * *"
      but was expecting "PyStringObject * *" for format code "S"
  which is overconstraining things: a (PyObject**) is fine there.
